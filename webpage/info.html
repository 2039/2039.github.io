		<h1>Very interesting facts about Lorem Ipsum</h1>
		<p>Lorem Ipsum is derived from classical Latin from the first century CE and has had further developments even to this day. 
		One of the main contributors to the language is Cicero, a well-known Roman philosopher, orator, and politician.
		His work "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) was especially influential
		and is the source of the name of the language.</p>
		<p>The name "Lorem Ipsum" comes from a longer phrase: 
		<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</blockquote>
		In Latin this would be 
		<blockquote>Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.</blockquote>
		As you can see, Lorem Ipsum differs significantly from classical Latin. The English translation is 
		<blockquote>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>Today, the language is mostly used by typographers, graphic designers, web and software developers, and resurrected Romans. 
		There is little active research about the language today, but its fascinating history and features make it an interesting field of study.</p>
