                This website was made by Eivind, Hauk-Morten, Kasper and Stine.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
                This website was made as a request from Laura Orem, an expert at Lorem Ipsum at the Dolor Sit Amet Institute in Trondheim. Laura has spent considerable time investigating and learning about this language, but has come to a halt. She  requested that we make a website with the hope that this may raise awareness and aid her research.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
                The purpose of this website is to make Lorem Ipsum more accessible to researches, as well as ressurected Romans who wants to access texts in their own language.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
                The tools this website provides can translate to Pig Latin in order to meet the needs of the Romans in order to let the learn about the world more efficiently. This will also help future Lorem researcher to become proficient in the language.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
                The website also contains a vast library of old Lorem Ipsum documents, as we aim to restore and preserve them for posterity.
